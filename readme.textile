h1. Water

Water takes a unified diff as its input and opens a browser window with a nicely formatted display of it. It uses CodeRay to highlight the code inside of the diff.

h2. Usage
 
bc. [git|svn|...] diff | water

h2. Installation

bc. gem install water

This will install a pre-release version of CodeRay (for syntax highlighting),
and launchy (along with its dependencies) to cross-platform browser opening.
